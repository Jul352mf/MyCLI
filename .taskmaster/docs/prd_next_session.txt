MyCLI — Next Session PRD (UI/UX Elevation)

Date: 2025-11-13
Owner: Jules / Project Team
Status: Draft

Problem
- Current UI hides many capabilities; lacks system layer view and rich project dashboard.

Goals (next session)
- System quick commands (processes/ports, kill, ngrok, custom quick commands)
- Project dashboard with Workspace, Command Center (with scope + params), X-Ray
- CRUD for URLs and start/stop mapping; descriptive messaging; improved palette
- Escape closes Env modal and other modals consistently
- Provide an agent prompt for repo preparation

Non-Goals
- Full Settings/OAuth, deep X-Ray analytics, full theming overhaul

Primary Users
- Devs needing a fast control plane across repos

IA
- Global: System Quick Commands menu
- Project: Dashboard with tabs (Workspace, Command Center, X-Ray)

Functional Requirements (scope)
- Processes/ports view & kill; ngrok MVP; custom quick commands CRUD
- Workspace: CRUD URLs; map start/stop
- Command Center: filter by scope, parameter UI execute from cwd
- Env modal: close on Esc; view-only
- Messaging & Theme: consistent status; palette tweaks

Data Model
- command_catalog.json overlay; quick_commands.json; project URLs/mapping persisted

Constraints
- Windows-first; monorepo supported via cwd; param extractor covers flags/key=val/<positional>

Acceptance
- System menu works (process/kill/ngrok/custom)
- Project workspace CRUD URLs/start-stop; Command Center filter/run with params
- Esc closes Env modal; palette visible

Milestones
- 1) System menu, 2) Workspace tab, 3) Command Center scope filter, 4) Palette & messaging, 5) Polish

Open Questions
- Settings OAuth now or later? Global vs project quick commands? X-Ray metrics priority?

Appendix: Agent Repo Prep Prompt
- Use Taskfile.yml tasks with desc and cmd; use <positional>, --flag, --key=value
- package.json scripts with descriptive names; include packageManager
- for monorepos, put Taskfile/package.json per subpackage; avoid vendor dirs
- .env.example; keep .env ignored; README section "Using with MyCLI"
